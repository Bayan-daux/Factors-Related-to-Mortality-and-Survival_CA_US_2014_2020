# Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview
Life expectancy has many different definitions based on the target analysis population. Life expectancy is generally intended to estimate the age that a certain group or population will die. There are many factors that affect the estimated age for the target population, such as gender, lifestyle, living condition, education level, etc. Nowadays, most of us are facing a variety of pressures. Due to environmental impacts coupled with climate change, the average life expectancy becomes
complicated and harder to predict.

For this analysis, we are going to focus on demographic and educational information. We are going to achieve two goals:
1. Analyze the relationship of each factor with the estimated age for the target population.
2. Build a linear regression model that will help us to predict the life expectancy for the target population.

## Analysis

Data Sources:
Census data across the states in the US for the years 2005 – 2015.
Demographic Data (census.gov)
Death data across the states in the US for the years 2005 – 2015.
NVSS - Mortality Data (cdc.gov)



## Results
Explain the relationship between each factor, which will include analysis with each corresponding estimated age.
The model will include all possible factors that could predict the life expectancy for the target population.

## Summary
From the analysis, we might be able to find the significance of each factor that affects the expected age, and which factors are weighted more heavily. We should be able to provide suggestions for people to live a better and longer life. Meanwhile, the
model will help us to predict the life expectancy for any target
population.
